# Graph-based-Neural-Network-for-Anomaly-Detection
Graph-based Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for anomaly detection on structured data represented as graphs.I tried to implement  a simple Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for anomaly detection on a synthetic dataset using Pytorch Geometric.
